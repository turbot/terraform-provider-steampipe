  handle = "dev"
}

resource "steampipecloud_connection" "dev_conn" {
  handle = "devconn"
  plugin = "bitbucket"
}

resource "steampipecloud_workspace_connection" "test" {
  workspace_handle  = steampipecloud_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  connection_handle = steampipecloud_connection.dev_conn.handle
}
```

**Create an organization workspace connection association**

```hcl
resource "steampipecloud_workspace" "org_dev_workspace" {
  organization = "testorg"
  handle       = "dev"
}

resource "steampipecloud_connection" "org_dev_conn" {
  organization = "testorg"
  handle       = "devconn"
  plugin       = "bitbucket"
}

resource "steampipecloud_workspace_connection" "org_test" {
  workspace_handle  = steampipecloud_workspace.org_dev_workspace.handle
  connection_handle = steampipecloud_connection.org_dev_conn.handle
}
```
